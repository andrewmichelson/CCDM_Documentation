As of February 2024, the Critical Care Data Mart had 17,892 unique medication formulations. At the inception of the data core, the decision was made not to algorithmically sorted medications into categories based on databases, but to hand curate them into clinically usable categories. While more labor intensive, it greatly enhances the fidelity and usability of the data and prevent things like oral rifaxamin from being considered antibiotic used to treat infections.

To facilitate usability of the electronic health record data, the data core has started to create comprehensive mappings for specific medications within specific classess thought to be of the highest yield. This list will undoubetly continue to grow over time and the list can be found [here].
